# Track 2 – How a Recommendation Becomes Reality

## What would be implemented?
We would implement an early-life retention program targeting Cluster 1 customers (new, low-tenure, high-risk segment). Within the first 90 days, flagged high-risk customers would receive structured onboarding, simplified billing explanations, and proactive outreach (email, SMS, and support follow-up).

This intervention would be triggered automatically using churn probability scores integrated into the company’s CRM system.

## What is the success metric and baseline?
The primary success metric would be a reduction in churn rate among Cluster 1 customers.

From our dataset, the overall company churn rate is 26.54%, while Cluster 1 specifically shows a churn rate of approximately 43%. 
The goal would be to reduce Cluster 1 churn from 43% to below 35% within one evaluation cycle.

One metric we would not want to worsen is customer acquisition cost (CAC) or overall customer satisfaction.
If the intervention feels too aggressive or too costly, it could reduce profitability or damage customer perception.

## How would impact be measured?

We would measure impact using an A/B test:

Group A: High-risk Cluster 1 customers receiving the onboarding intervention.

Group B: High-risk Cluster 1 customers receiving standard treatment.

After 3–6 months, we would compare:

  -Churn rates

  -Retention lift

  -Revenue per customer

  -Customer satisfaction scores

Some risks may be over-targeting, 
where customers may feel overwhelmed by excessive communication, 
which could increase dissatisfaction instead of reducing churn. And other risk may be 
the cost riks, where incentives and additional support resources may increase short-term operational costs.
