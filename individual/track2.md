# Track 2 – How a Recommendation Becomes Reality

## What would be implemented?
We would implement an early-life retention program targeting Cluster 1 customers (new, low-tenure, high-risk segment). Within the first 90 days, flagged high-risk customers would receive structured onboarding, simplified billing explanations, and proactive outreach (email, SMS, and support follow-up).

This intervention would be triggered automatically using churn probability scores integrated into the company’s CRM system.

## What is the success metric and baseline?
The primary success metric would be a reduction in churn rate among Cluster 1 customers.

From our dataset, the overall company churn rate is 26.54%, while Cluster 1 specifically shows a churn rate of approximately 43%. 
The goal would be to reduce Cluster 1 churn from 43% to below 35% within one evaluation cycle.

One metric we would not want to worsen is customer acquisition cost (CAC) or overall customer satisfaction.
If the intervention feels too aggressive or too costly, it could reduce profitability or damage customer perception.
