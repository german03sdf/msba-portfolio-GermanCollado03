#Individual Contribution

## What did you personally contribute to the most?

Throughout the project, I contributed most to the development of the presentation and to the discussions around improving the model. While Spencer ran the final version of the model, we worked collaboratively as a team to review performance, interpret the results, and think about how we could refine it. I was actively involved in those conversations and helped evaluate different ideas on how to strengthen the approach.

I also put effort into structuring and building the slides. I wanted to make sure our presentation told a clear story, not just numbers. I focused on helping translate the technical results into business language so that someone without a predictive analytics background could still understand the value of what we built.

## One decision or approach I personally advocated for

One approach I personally pushed for was simplifying how we communicated our project. I realized that most people listening to our presentation would not be familiar with machine learning models or performance metrics.

Because of that, I encouraged us to focus less on technical complexity and more on clarity. I tried to frame our insights using simple examples and real-life scenarios that everyone could relate to. My goal was to make sure the audience understood why the model mattered, not just how it worked.

## Lessons learned and what I would improve

I honestly learned a lot from this project. One of the biggest takeaways for me was realizing how transferable predictive analytics is across industries. The structure we followed in this case, defining a business problem, building a model, validating it, and translating it into decisions, can apply to almost any type of company.

Personally, I would love to apply what we learned to the banking industry, especially in building a predictive model around credit risk and probability of default. This project helped me see how the tools we use in class have very real applications in finance and risk management.

If I had more time, I would improve my understanding earlier in the process. At the beginning of the assignment, I did not fully see how all the course concepts connected. It was only once I really immersed myself in the project that everything started to come together. By the end, I had a much clearer understanding of the full modeling pipeline, which made the experience very rewarding.
