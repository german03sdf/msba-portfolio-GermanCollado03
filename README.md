# MSBA Portfolio – Predictive Analytics Case Competition  
### German Collado  
Spring 2026


## Business Problem

The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model that helps
a company identify customers who may be at risk of leaving.
By proactively detecting at-risk customers, the company can design targeted 
retention strategies to improve long-term profitability and customer lifetime value.

## Key Results

- Achieved strong predictive performance using XGBoost with cross-validation.
- Identified tenure, service intensity, and contract type as key drivers.
- Built a reproducible modeling pipeline from preprocessing to evaluation.

## How to Run the Code

1. Download or clone this repository to your computer.
2. Open the project in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Make sure you have the required libraries installed.
4. Open the main notebook and run the cells from top to bottom.
5. The model outputs and evaluation metrics will appear directly in the notebook.

## Limitation

The model is trained on historical data and assumes future customer behavior
follows similar patterns. Changes in pricing, competitive landscape, or customer behavior may 
impact model performance over time
